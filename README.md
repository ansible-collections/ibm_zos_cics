# IBM z/OS CICS collection

The **IBM® z/OS® CICS® collection**, also represented as **ibm\_zos\_cics**
in this document, is part of the broader initiative to bring Ansible Automation to IBM Z® through the offering
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z®**. The **IBM z/OS CICS collection** supports management of CICS
resources and definitions through the CMCI REST API provided by CICS as well as provisioning of standalone CICS regions.

This CICS collection works in conjunction with other Ansible collections for IBM Z,
such as the [IBM z/OS core collection](https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core).
It is also possible to use it independently to perform automation tasks solely in CICS.


## Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z

**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z** provides the ability to
connect IBM Z® to clients' wider enterprise automation strategy through the
Ansible Automation Platform ecosystem. This enables development and operations
automation on Z through a seamless, unified workflow orchestration with
configuration management, provisioning, and application deployment in
one easy-to-use platform.

The **IBM z/OS CICS collection** is following the
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z®** method of distributing
content. Collections will be developed in the open, and when content is ready
for use it is released to
[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/search?keywords=zos_&order_by=-relevance&deprecated=false&type=collection&page=1)
for community adoption. Once contributors review community usage, feedback,
and are satisfied with the content published, the collection will then be
released to [Ansible Automation Hub](https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-hub)
as **certified** and **IBM supported** for
**Red Hat® Ansible Automation Platform subscribers**.
