v2.1.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

General Availability of CICS provisioning modules. You can use these Ansible modules to create automation tasks that provision or deprovision, and start or stop a CICS region. Sample playbooks show you how to do this with the latest version of the Ansible IBM z/OS CICS collection. All modules were initially released with Version 1.1.0-beta as noted below. Subsequent Version 1.1.0-beta releases may include enhancements and bugfixes for these modules. Refer to the What's new of Version 1.1.0-beta releases for details.
This release replaces all the previous 1.1.0-beta* releases.
You can use the following modules for provisioning and managing CICS TS data sets
``aux_temp_storage`` for the CICS auxiliary temporary storage data set. This module was initially released as ``auxiliary_temp`` with Version 1.1.0-beta.4. The module is changed to ``aux_temp_storage`` in Version 2.1.0.
``aux_trace`` for the CICS auxiliary trace data sets. This module was initially released as ``trace`` with Version 1.1.0-beta.4. The module is changed to ``aux_trace`` in Version 2.1.0.
``csd`` for the CICS system definition data set. This module was initially released with Version 1.1.0-beta.4.
``global_catalog`` for the CICS global catalog data set. This module was initially released with Version 1.1.0-beta.4.
``local_request_queue`` for the CICS local request queue data set. This module was initially released with Version 1.1.0-beta.3.
``td_intrapartition`` for the CICS transient data intrapartition data set. This module was initially released as ``intrapartition`` with Version 1.1.0-beta.4. The module is changed to ``td_intrapartition`` in Version 2.1.0.
``transaction_dump`` for the CICS transaction dump data sets. This module was initially released with Version 1.1.0-beta.4.
You can use the following modules for CICS startup and shutdown operations
``region_jcl`` - Create a CICS startup JCL data set. This module replaces ``start_cics``, which was released with Version 1.1.0-beta.5. ``region_jcl`` is significantly different from ``start_cics`` in function. ``region_jcl`` creates a data set that contains the startup JCL, but doesn't perform the actual startup processing. ``region_jcl`` also supports definition and allocation of user data sets with the ``user_data_sets`` parameter.
``stop_region`` - Stop a CICS region. This module was initially released as ``stop_cics`` with Version 1.1.0-beta.5. The module is changed to ``stop_region`` in Version 2.1.0. In Version 2.1.0, ``stop_region`` supports a new input parameter, ``job_name`` so that you can use the job name, which is typically the CICS's APPLID, to identify a running CICS region.
The group name for the CICS provisioning modules is ``region``. However, in the Version 1.1.0-beta releases, the group name was ``region_group``.
CICS provisioning modules provide support for all in-service CICS TS releases including the latest CICS TS 6.2.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- The group name for the CMCI modules is changed to ``cmci`` instead of ``cmci_group``. ``cmci_group`` is deprecated.
