      release_summary: 'General Availability of CICS provisioning modules. You can
        use these Ansible modules to create automation tasks that provision or deprovision,
        and start or stop a CICS region. Sample playbooks show you how to do this
        with the latest version of the Ansible IBM z/OS CICS collection. All modules
        were initially released with Version 1.1.0-beta as noted below. Subsequent
        Version 1.1.0-beta releases may include enhancements and bugfixes for these
        modules. Refer to the What''s new of Version 1.1.0-beta releases for details.

        This release replaces all the previous 1.1.0-beta* releases.

        You can use the following modules for provisioning and managing CICS TS data
        sets

        ``aux_temp_storage`` for the CICS auxiliary temporary storage data set. This
        module was initially released as ``auxiliary_temp`` with Version 1.1.0-beta.4.
        The module is changed to ``aux_temp_storage`` in Version 2.1.0.

        ``aux_trace`` for the CICS auxiliary trace data sets. This module was initially
        released as ``trace`` with Version 1.1.0-beta.4. The module is changed to
        ``aux_trace`` in Version 2.1.0.

        ``csd`` for the CICS system definition data set. This module was initially
        released with Version 1.1.0-beta.4.

        ``global_catalog`` for the CICS global catalog data set. This module was initially
        released with Version 1.1.0-beta.4.

        ``local_request_queue`` for the CICS local request queue data set. This module
        was initially released with Version 1.1.0-beta.3.

        ``td_intrapartition`` for the CICS transient data intrapartition data set.
        This module was initially released as ``intrapartition`` with Version 1.1.0-beta.4.
        The module is changed to ``td_intrapartition`` in Version 2.1.0.

        ``transaction_dump`` for the CICS transaction dump data sets. This module
        was initially released with Version 1.1.0-beta.4.

        You can use the following modules for CICS startup and shutdown operations

        ``region_jcl`` - Create a CICS startup JCL data set. This module replaces
        ``start_cics``, which was released with Version 1.1.0-beta.5. ``region_jcl``
        is significantly different from ``start_cics`` in function. ``region_jcl``
        creates a data set that contains the startup JCL, but doesn''t perform the
        actual startup processing. ``region_jcl`` also supports definition and allocation
        of user data sets with the ``user_data_sets`` parameter.

        ``stop_region`` - Stop a CICS region. This module was initially released as
        ``stop_cics`` with Version 1.1.0-beta.5. The module is changed to ``stop_region``
        in Version 2.1.0. In Version 2.1.0, ``stop_region`` supports a new input parameter,
        ``job_name`` so that you can use the job name, which is typically the CICS''s
        APPLID, to identify a running CICS region.

        The group name for the CICS provisioning modules is ``region``. However, in
        the Version 1.1.0-beta releases, the group name was ``region_group``.

        CICS provisioning modules provide support for all in-service CICS TS releases
        including the latest CICS TS 6.2.'
