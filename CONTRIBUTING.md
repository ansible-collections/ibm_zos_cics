### Signing your contribution

You must declare that you wrote the code that you contribute, or that you have the right to contribute someone else's code. To do so, you must sign the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org) (DCO):

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```


If you can certify the above, then sign off each Git commit at the bottom of the commit message with the following:

```
Signed-off-by: My Name <my.name@example.com>
```

You must use your real name and email address.

To save you having to type the above for every commit, Git can add the `Signed-off-by` line. When committing, add the `-s` option to your `git commit` command.

If you haven't signed each commit, then the pull request will fail to pass all checks.
