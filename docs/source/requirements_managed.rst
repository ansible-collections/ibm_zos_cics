Requirements of managed nodes
=============================

The CMCI tasks in the **IBM® z/OS® CICS® collection** interact
with the managed node over an HTTP connection by leveraging the `CMCI REST API`_.
Therefore, an SSH connection is not required. Instead, you can delegate
Ansible tasks to run on the control node, for example, by specifying
``delegate_to: 'localhost'`` for the task in the playbook. In this case, you
install dependencies on your localhost instead of the managed node.
For more ways of delegating tasks, see `Controlling where tasks run`_.

The requirements of the managed node are as follows:

* IBM CICS V4.2 or later
* A `CMCI connection`_ must be set up in either a CICSplex or a stand-alone CICS region
* Python module dependencies:

  * `requests`_
  * `xmltodict`_
  * `typing`_ (For Python versions < 3.5)

  If you delegate the tasks to run on your localhost, the Python module dependencies
  need to be installed on your localhost instead.

  You can install them from CLI:

  * If your Python version is no less than 3.5:

    .. code-block:: sh

       pip install requests xmltodict

  * If your Python version < 3.5:

    .. code-block:: sh

       pip install requests xmltodict typing


  You can also install them using the playbook. For example, this `CICS
  sample playbook`_ shows how you can ensure the pre-requisites are installed before the module is executed.

.. _xmltodict:

.. _typing:

If you use the CICS collection in conjunction with other IBM z/OS collections,
your managed node must also follow the requirements of those collections, for example, `IBM z/OS core managed node requirements`_.

If you use the CICS collection alone but don't delegate the CICS tasks to your localhost, your managed node must also follow the `IBM z/OS core managed node requirements`_ except that IBM Z Open Automation Utilities (ZOAU) is not required.
