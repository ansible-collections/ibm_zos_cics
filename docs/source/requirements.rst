Requirements
============

A control node is any machine with Ansible installed. From the control node,
you can run commands and playbooks from a laptop, desktop, or server.
However, you cannot run **IBM z/OS CICS collection** on a Windows system.

A managed node is often referred to as a target node, or host, and it is managed
by Ansible. Ansible need not be installed on a managed node, but SSH must be
enabled.

The nodes listed below require these specific versions of software:

Control node
------------

* `Ansible version`_: 2.9 or later
* `Python`_: 2.7 or later
* `OpenSSH`_
* `IBM z/OS core collection`_

.. _Ansible version:

Python on z/OS
--------------

If the Ansible target is z/OS, you must install a Python distribution ported
for this platform. Rocket Software is currently the preferred version for z/OS.

**Installation**

* Visit the `Rocket Software homepage`_ and create a required account in the
  `Rocket Customer Portal`_.
* Click Downloads on the top left portion the page.
* Select the category z/OpenSource on the left panel.
* Scroll and select Python.
* Download the binaries, installation files, and the README.ZOS onto an x86
  machine.
* Transfer the zipped tarball (tar.gz) file to the target z/OS system and
  extract it according to the instructions in the installation files.
* Follow the additional setup instructions as described in the README.ZOS file.
