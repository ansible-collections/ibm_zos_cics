stop_region -- Stop a CICS region
=================================



.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------
- Stop a CICS region by issuing a CEMT PERFORM SHUTDOWN command, or by canceling the job through the :literal:`jobs.cancel` utility provided by Z Open Automation Utilities (ZOAU). You can choose the shutdown mode from NORMAL, IMMEDIATE, or CANCEL.
- The :literal:`job\_id`\ , :literal:`job\_name`\ , or both can be used to shut down a CICS region. If mulitple jobs are running with the same name, the :literal:`job\_id` is required.
- During a NORMAL or IMMEDIATE shutdown, a shutdown assist transaction should run to enable CICS to shut down in a controlled manner. By default, the CICS-supplied shutdown assist transaction, CESD is used. You can specify a custom shutdown assist transaction in the SDTRAN system initialization parameter. The task runs until the region has successfully shut down, or until the shutdown fails.
- You must have a console installed in the CICS region so that the stop\_region module can communicate with CICS. To define a console, you must install a terminal with the CONSNAME attribute set to your TSO user ID. For detailed instructions, see \ `Defining TSO users as console devices <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cics-ts/latest?topic=cics-defining-tso-users-as-console-devices>`__. Add your console definition into one of the resource lists defined on the GRPLIST system initialization parameter so that it gets installed into the CICS region. Alternatively, you can use a DFHCSDUP script to update an existing CSD. This function is provided by the csd module.
- You can specify a timeout, in seconds, for CICS shutdown processing. After a request to stop CICS is issued, if CICS shutdown processing is not completed when this timeout is reached, the module completes in a failed state. By default, the stop\_region module does not use a timeout, that is, the :literal:`timeout` parameter assumes a value of -1.





Parameters
----------


     
job_id
  Identifies the job ID belonging to the running CICS region.

  The stop\_region module uses this job ID to identify the state of the CICS region and shut it down.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


     
job_name
  Identifies the job name belonging to the running CICS region.

  The stop\_region module uses this job name to identify the state of the CICS region and shut it down.

  The :literal:`job\_name` must be unique; if multiple jobs with the same name are running, use :literal:`job\_id`.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


     
mode
  Specify the type of shutdown to be executed on the CICS region.

  Specify :literal:`normal` to perform a normal shutdown. This instructs the stop\_region module to issue a CEMT PERFORM SHUTDOWN command.

  Specify :literal:`immediate` to perform an immediate shutdown. This instructs the stop\_region module to issue a CEMT PERFORM SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE command.

  Specify :literal:`cancel` to cancel the CICS region. This instructs the stop\_region module to use ZOAU's :literal:`jobs.cancel` utility to process the request.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str
  | **default**: normal
  | **choices**: normal, immediate, cancel


     
no_sdtran
  No shutdown assist transaction is to be run at CICS shutdown.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool


     
sdtran
  The 4-character identifier of the shutdown assist transaction.

  The default shutdown transaction, if neither SDTRAN nor NOSDTRAN is specified, is CESD.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


     
timeout
  The maximum time, in seconds, to wait for CICS shutdown processing to complete.

  Specify -1 to exclude a timeout.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: int
  | **default**: -1
