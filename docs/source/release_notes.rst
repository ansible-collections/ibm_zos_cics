What's New
-------------------
Initial release of the **IBM® z/OS® CICS® collection**, also referred to as **ibm_zos_cics**, which is part of the broader offering **Red Hat® Ansible® Certified Content for IBM Z®**.

This collection can manage CICS and CICSPlex® SM resources and definitions by calling the `CMCI REST API`_, which can be configured in a CICSplex or in a stand-alone region.

* Modules

  * ``cmci_create`` - Create definitional CICS and CICSPlex SM resources in CICS regions, by initiating POST requests via the CMCI REST API.
  * ``cmci_delete`` - Remove or discard definitional and installed CICS and CICSPlex SM resources from CICS regions, by initiating DELETE requests via the CMCI REST API.
  * ``cmci_get`` - Retrieve information about installed and definitional CICS and CICSPlex SM resources from CICS regions, by initiating GET requests via the CMCI REST API.
  * ``cmci_action`` - Install CICS and CICSPlex SM resources into CICS regions from definitions, by initiating PUT requests via the CMCI REST API.
  * ``cmci_update`` - Make changes to CICS and CICSPlex SM resources in CICS regions, by initiating PUT requests via the CMCI REST API.


* Documentation

  * Generic documentation is available at `the documentation site`_, covering guidance on installation, modules, and other reference.

  * Documentation related to playbook configuration is provided with sample playbooks at the `samples repository`_. Each playbook contains a README that explains what configurations must be made to run a sample playbook.
