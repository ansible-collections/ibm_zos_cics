IBM z/OS CICS collection
===========================
Collections are a distribution format for prepackaged Ansible® content including playbooks, modules, and so on that enable you to quickly set up your automation project.

The **IBM® z/OS® CICS® collection**, also represented as **ibm\_zos\_cics**
in this document, provides tasks to define, install, and perform actions on CICS definitions and resources such as creating a PROGRAM definition, installing and updating it, and deleting the definition.

This CICS collection can work independently from other IBM z/OS modules on Ansible to perform tasks in CICS. You can, however, to use it in conjunction with the `IBM z/OS core collection`_ to deliver a solution that will enable you to automate tasks on z/OS. If you choose to do that, you can refer to their documentation for the extra configuration needed.
