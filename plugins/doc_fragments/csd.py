    description:
      - The unit portion of the CSD size. Note that this is
        just the unit; the value for the primary space is specified with O(space_primary)
        and the value for the secondary space is specified with O(space_secondary).
      - This option takes effect only when the CSD is being created.
        If the CSD already exists, the option has no effect.
      - The size can be specified in megabytes (V(m)), kilobytes (V(k)),

  state:
    description:
      - The intended state for the CSD, which the module aims to achieve.
      - Specify V(absent) to remove the CSD entirely, if it already exists.
      - Specify V(initial) to create the CSD if it does not already exist, and initialize it by using DFHCSDUP.
      - Specify V(warm) to retain an existing CSD in its current state.
        The module verifies whether the specified data set exists and whether it contains any records.
        If both conditions are met, the module leaves the data set as is.
        If the data set does not exist or if it is empty, the operation fails.
      - Specify V(changed) to run a DFHCSDUP script to update an existing CSD.
    choices:
      - "initial"
      - "absent"
      - "warm"
      - "changed"
    required: true

      - Specify V(uss) to load from a file on UNIX System Services (USS).
      - Specify V(local) to load from a file local to the Ansible control node.
      - Specify V(inline) to allow a script to be passed directly through the O(input_content) parameter.

      - "local"
      - "inline"

      - The path to the source file that contains the DFHCSDUP script to submit.
      - 'It can be a data set. For example: "TESTER.DEFS.SCRIPT" or "TESTER.DEFS(SCRIPT)"'
      - 'It can be a USS file. For example: "/u/tester/defs/script.csdup"'

    type: str

  log:
    description:
      - Specify the recovery attribute for the CSD, overriding the CSD system initialization parameters.
      - Specify NONE for a nonrecoverable CSD.
      - Specify UNDO for a CSD that is limited to file backout only.
      - Specify ALL for a CSD for which you want both forward recovery and file backout. If you specify O(log=ALL), you
        must also specify LOGSTREAMID to identify the 26-character name of the z/OS™ log stream to be used as the
        forward recovery log. The CICS collection does not support defining forward recovery log streams; you
        must follow the instructions in L(Defining forward recovery log streams,
        https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cics-ts/latest?topic=journaling-defining-forward-recovery-log-streams).
    choices:
      - "NONE"
      - "UNDO"
      - "ALL"
    required: false
    type: str
  logstream_id:
    description:
      - The 26-character name of the z/OS™ log stream to be used as the forward recovery log.
      - This is required when you use O(log=ALL).
