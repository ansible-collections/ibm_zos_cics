        see the B(CMAS context) entry in the CICSPlex SM resource table
        reference of a resource. For example, according to the
        L(PROGRAM resource table,https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGMCP_5.6.0/reference-cpsm-restables/cpsm-restables/PROGRAMtab.html),
        CMAS context is not supported for PROGRAM.

        APPLID of the CICS region associate with the request.

        CICS systems or resources.
      - I(scope) is optional. If it's not specified, the request is limited by
        the value of I(context) alone.

            used as criteria to filter the set of resources returned from
            CICSPlex SM.
          - Filters implicitly use the C(=) operator.
          - Filters for C(string) type attributes can use the C(*) and C(+)
            wildcard operators.
          - C(*) is a wildcard representing an unknown number of characters,
            and must appear at the end of the value.
          - C(+) is a wildcard representing a single character, and can appear
            in any place in the value, potentially multiple times.
          - To use more complicated filter expressions, including a range of
            different filter operators, and the ability to compose filters with
            C(and) and C(or) operators, see the C(complex_filter) parameter.
          - For more details, see
            L(How to build a filter expression,https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.6.0/system-programming/cpsm/eyup1a0.html).
          - For examples, see M(cmci_get).

            expression, a list of filter expressions to be composed with the
            C(and) operator, or a list of filter expressions to be composed
            with the C(or) operator.
          - The C(attribute), C(and) and C(or) options are mutually exclusive
            with each other.
          - Can contain one or more filters. Multiple filters must be combined
            using C(and) or C(or) logical operators.
          - Filters can be nested.
          - When supplying the C(attribute) option, you must also supply a
            C(value) for the filter. You can also override the default
            operator of C(=) with the C(operator) option.
