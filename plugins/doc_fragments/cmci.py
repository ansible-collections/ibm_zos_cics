        see the B(CMAS context) entry in the CICSPlex SM resource table
        reference of a resource.
        For example, according to the L(PROGRAM resource table,
        https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGMCP_5.6.0/reference-cpsm-restables/cpsm-restables/PROGRAMtab.html),
        CMAS context is not supported for PROGRAM.
      - If CMCI is installed in a single region (SMSS), I(context) is the
        APPLID of the CICS region associate with the request.

      - I(scope) is a subset of I(context) and limits the request to particular
        CICS systems or resources.
      - I(scope) is optional. If it's not specified, the request is limited by
        the value of I(context) alone.

        case-sensitive.
