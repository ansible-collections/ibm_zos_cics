      - The size of the primary space allocated to the transaction dump data set.
        Note that this is just the value; the unit is specified with O(space_type).
      - This option takes effect only when the transaction dump data set is being created.
        If the data set already exists, the option has no effect.

        Note that this is just the value; the unit is specified with O(space_type).
      - This option takes effect only when the transaction dump data set is being created.
        If the data set already exists, the option has no effect.

    description:
      - The unit portion of the transaction dump data set size. Note that this is
        just the unit; the value for the primary space is specified with O(space_primary) and
        the value for the secondary space is specified with O(space_secondary).
      - This option takes effect only when the transaction dump data set is being created.
        If the data set already exists, the option has no effect.
      - The size can be specified in megabytes (V(m)), kilobytes (V(k)),
        cylinders (V(cyl)), or tracks (V(trl)).

  destination:
    description:
      - Identifies which one of the transaction dump data sets is the target of the operation.
        If the value is left blank, A is implied, but you can specify A or B.
      - Specify V(A) to create or delete the A data set.
      - Specify V(B) to create or delete the B data set. This MUST be set for the creation of the B data set.
    choices:
      - "A"
      - "B"
    type: str
    required: false
    default: "A"
  state:
    description:
      - The intended state for the transaction dump data set, which the module aims to achieve.
      - Specify V(absent) to remove the transaction dump data set entirely, if it exists.
      - Specify V(initial) to create the transaction dump data set if it does not exist.
        If the specified data set exists but is empty, the module leaves the data set as is.
        If the specified data set exists and has contents, the module deletes the data set and then creates a new, empty one.
      - Specify V(warm) to retain an existing transaction dump data set in its current state.
        The module verifies whether the specified data set exists and whether it contains any records.
        If both conditions are met, the module leaves the data set as is.
        If the data set does not exist or if it is empty, the operation fails.

      - "initial"
