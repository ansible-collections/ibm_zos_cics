options:
  space_primary:
    description:
      - The size of the primary space allocated to the auxiliary trace data set.
        Note that this is just the value; the unit is specified with O(space_type).
      - This option takes effect only when the auxiliary trace data set is being created.
        If the data set already exists, the option has no effect.
    type: int

    description:
      - The size of the secondary space allocated to the auxiliary trace data set.
        Note that this is just the value; the unit is specified with O(space_type).
      - This option takes effect only when the auxiliary trace data set is being created.
        If the data set already exists, the option has no effect.
    type: int

    default: 4
  space_type:
    description:
      - The unit portion of the auxiliary trace data set size. Note that this is
        just the unit; the value for the primary space is specified with O(space_primary) and
        the value for the secondary space is specified with O(space_secondary).
      - This option takes effect only when the auxiliary trace data set is being created.
        If the data set already exists, the option has no effect.
      - The size can be specified in megabytes (V(m)), kilobytes (V(k)),
        cylinders (V(cyl)), or tracks (V(trk)).

    description:
      - The volume(s) where the data set is created. Use a string to define a singular volume or a list of strings for multiple volumes.
    type: raw

  region_data_sets:
    description:
      - The location of the region data sets to be created by using a template, for example,
        C(REGIONS.ABCD0001.<< data_set_name >>).
      - If you want to use a data set that already exists, ensure that the data set is an auxiliary trace data set.

  destination:
    description:
      - Identify which one of the auxiliary trace data sets is the target of the operation.
        If the value is left blank, A is implied, but you can specify A or B.
      - Specify V(A) to create or delete the A data set.
      - Specify V(B) to create or delete the B data set. This MUST be set for the creation of the B data set.
    choices:
      - "A"
      - "B"
    type: str
    required: false
    default: "A"
  state:
    description:
      - The intended state for the auxiliary trace data set, which the module aims to achieve.
      - Specify V(absent) to remove the auxiliary trace data set data set entirely, if it exists.
      - Specify V(initial) to create the auxiliary trace data set if it does not exist.
        If the specified data set exists but is empty, the module leaves the data set as is.
        If the specified data set exists and has contents, the module deletes the data set and then creates a new, empty one.
      - Specify V(warm) to retain an existing auxiliary trace data set in its current state.
        The module checks whether the specified data set exists, and if it does, leaves the data set as is.
        If the data set does not exist, the operation fails.

      - "initial"
      - "absent"
