      - The size of the primary space allocated to the local request queue data set.
        Note that this is just the value; the unit is specified with O(space_type).
      - This option takes effect when the local request queue data set is being created.
        If the data set already exists, the option has no effect.

      - The size of the secondary space allocated to the local request queue data set.
        Note that this is just the value; the unit is specified with O(space_type).

      - The unit portion of the local request queue data set size. Note that this is
        just the unit; the value for the primary space is specified with O(space_primary) and
        the value for the secondary space is specified with O(space_secondary).
      - This option takes effect only when the local request queue data set is being created.
        If the data set already exists, the option has no effect.
      - The size can be specified in megabytes (V(m)), kilobytes (V(k)),
        records (V(rec)), cylinders (V(cyl)), or tracks (V(trk)).

      - The location of the region data sets to be created by using a template, for example,
        C(REGIONS.ABCD0001.<< data_set_name >>).

  state:
    description:
      - The intended state for the local request queue, which the module aims to achieve.
      - Specify V(absent) to remove the local request queue data set entirely, if it exists.
      - Specify V(initial) to create the local request queue data set if it does not exist,
        or empty this existing local request queue of all records.
      - Specify V(warm) to retain an existing local request queue data set in its current state.
        The module checks whether the specified data set exists, and if it does, leaves the data set as is.
        If the data set does not exist, the operation fails.
