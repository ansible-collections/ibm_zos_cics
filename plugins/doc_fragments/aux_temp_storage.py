options:
  space_primary:
    description:
      - The size of the primary space allocated to the auxiliary temporary storage data set.
        Note that this is just the value; the unit is specified with O(space_type).
      - This option takes effect only when the auxiliary temporary storage data set is being created.
        If the data set already exists, the option has no effect.
    type: int

  space_secondary:
    description:
      - The size of the secondary space allocated to the auxiliary temporary storage data set.
        Note that this is just the value; the unit is specified with O(space_type).
      - This option takes effect only when the auxiliary temporary storage data set is being created.
        If the data set already exists, the option has no effect.
    type: int

  space_type:
    description:
      - The unit portion of the auxiliary temporary storage data set size. Note that this is
        just the unit; the value for the primary space is specified with O(space_primary) and the value
        for the secondary space is specified with O(space_secondary).
      - This option takes effect only when the auxiliary temporary storage data set is being created.
        If the data set already exists, the option has no effect.
      - The size can be specified in megabytes (V(m)), kilobytes (V(k)),
        records (V(rec)), cylinders (V(cyl)), or tracks (V(trk)).

  region_data_sets:
    description:
      - The location of the region data sets to be created by using a template, for example,
        C(REGIONS.ABCD0001.<< data_set_name >>).
      - If you want to use a data set that already exists, ensure that the data set is an auxiliary temporary storage data set.

      template:
        description:
          - The base location of the region data sets with a template.

            required: false
  state:
    description:
      - The intended state for the auxiliary temporary storage data set, which the module aims to
        achieve.
      - Specify V(absent) to remove the auxiliary temporary storage data set entirely, if it
        already exists.
      - Specify V(initial) to create the auxiliary temporary storage data set, if it does not exist.
        If the specified data set exists but is empty, the module leaves the data set as is.
        If the specified data set exists and has contents, the module deletes the data set and then creates a new, empty data set.
      - Specify V(warm) to retain an existing auxiliary temporary storage data set in its current state.
        The module checks whether the specified data set exists, and if it does, leaves the data set as is.
        If the data set does not exist, the operation fails.
