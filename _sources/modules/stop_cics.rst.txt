stop_cics -- Stop a CICS Region
===============================



.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------
- Stop a CICS region by using CEMT PERFORM SHUTDOWN. You can choose to perform a NORMAL or IMMEDIATE shutdown. During a NORMAL or IMMEDIATE shutdown, a shutdown assist program should run to enable CICS to shut down in a controlled manner. By default, the CICS-supplied shutdown assist transaction, CESD is used. You can specify a custom shutdown assist program in the SDTRAN system initialization parameter. The task runs until the region has successfully shut down, or until the shutdown fails.





Parameters
----------


     
job_id
  Identifies the job ID belonging to the running CICS region.

  The Stop CICS module uses this job ID to identify the state of the CICS region and shut it down.


  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


     
mode
  Specify the type of shutdown to be executed on the CICS Region.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str
  | **default**: normal
  | **choices**: normal, immediate, cancel




Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

   
   - name: "Stop CICS"
     ibm.ibm_zos_cics.stop_cics:
       job_id: JOB12345

   - name: "Stop CICS immediately"
     ibm.ibm_zos_cics.stop_cics:
       job_id: JOB12354
       mode: immediate
